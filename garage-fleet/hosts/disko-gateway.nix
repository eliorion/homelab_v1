# hosts/disko-gateway.nix — disk layout for the GATEWAY node (node-D).
#
# A gateway holds NO Garage partitions (capacity 0, doc 09 §3/§5), so there is
# NO ZFS data pool and NO sanoid here — just a simple boot + root disk. Garage's
# meta/data dirs on node-D are tiny local dirs created by modules/garage.nix
# (the binary needs the dirs even with no data).
#
# ⚠️ node-D is ALREADY IN PRODUCTION (doc 10 Phase 3). This layout is for a
#    GREENFIELD reinstall only. If node-D is reconfigured ADDITIVELY in place
#    (the doc 10 Phase 3 path — do NOT wipe it), DO NOT import this disko module;
#    keep its existing partitioning and only add services.garage. This file
#    exists so node-D can be rebuilt from bare metal if ever needed.
