# hosts/disko-storage.nix — declarative disk + ZFS layout for STORAGE nodes
# (A/B/C). Imported by node-a/-b/-c (doc 09 §5/§7, doc 10 Phase 1 disko skeleton).
#
# One ZFS pool `bpool` with the encryption boundary at `bpool/garage` and
# separate meta (small recordsize) + data (large recordsize) datasets on which
# Garage stores metadata + data — node-local ZFS, NOT Longhorn, to break the
# backing-up-the-thing-you-back-up circular dependency (doc 09 §5).
#
# ⚠️ disko create-mode DESTROYS the target disk. Only ever run nixos-anywhere on
#    a node BEFORE it holds backups (doc 10 risk register).
#
# BOOT-TRUST CAVEAT (doc 09 §7, doc 10 Phase 1 boot-trust note):
#   keylocation = file://… + a sops-nix-persisted passphrase means the node
#   AUTO-UNLOCKS at boot — the age identity that decrypts the passphrase lives
#   on the same disk (derived from the on-disk SSH host key). So ZFS-at-rest
#   here protects ONLY against media-only theft (a pulled platter / RMA'd disk),
#   NOT whole-box theft. The unattended offsite nodes (B/C) are exactly where
#   whole-box theft is most plausible. We ACCEPT auto-unlock; the real theft
#   mitigation is client-side payload encryption on the restic/Kopia paths
#   (Garage stores only ciphertext for those). To keep a stolen offsite box
#   LOCKED instead, switch that node to keylocation=prompt or initrd-SSH /
#   Tailscale remote unlock and accept the unattended-reboot toil (opt-in).
#
# ⚠️ KEY PERSISTENCE — file:///tmp/zfs.key BELOW IS INSTALL-SEED-ONLY.
#   disko/nixos-anywhere uses keylocation to load the key at POOL CREATION (the
#   seed file passed via --disk-encryption-keys). /tmp is tmpfs and the seed is
#   GONE after the first reboot, so as written the node will NOT reboot-unlock —
#   and a plaintext passphrase under world-traversable /tmp is itself a leak. The
#   documented "persisted via sops-nix" model is NOT satisfied by this line
#   alone. The operator MUST, before relying on reboot-unlock:
#     1. put the real passphrase in secrets/common.sops.yaml under `zfs-passphrase`
#        (declared as a sops-nix secret in modules/sops.nix, owner root 0400), and
#     2. either repoint keylocation at the decrypted secret path
#        (file://${config.sops.secrets."zfs-passphrase".path}) once sops-nix has
#        materialised it, OR add a boot-time systemd unit that runs
#        `zfs load-key bpool/garage` from that path, ordered after sops-nix.
#   Until then treat /tmp/zfs.key as the install seed only and expect a manual
#   `zfs load-key` after any reboot. The at-rest-encryption claim (media-only
#   theft) holds only once the key lives encrypted-at-rest via sops-nix, not /tmp.
